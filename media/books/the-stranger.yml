review: A lot funnier than I was expecting this to be. Of course the great underlying joke being how the world insists to derive motive and reasoning from a completely unmotivated and detached Meursault. I feel like further readings, in light of the last chapter, will reveal greater depths towards what appears to be a absurdly surface-level individual.
