    status: There is a bit of whiplash so far going from Kafka on the shore, which is super surreal and dreamlike, to what seems to be a far more grounded work with this, still digging it though. # notes about a given update

rating: I can appreciate to some extent that this is one of Murakami's earlier works, and that it represents a notable divergence from his more typical style, being more stripped back and direct. But I think with this divergence, what makes Murakami special is replaced by some of the more obnoxious trappings of his work. There are moments contained within the narrative that I think are poignant, but it always feels slightly undercut by how bizarrely the world interacts with Toru, lauding him for the most inane of comments and gestures. I desperately wanted to love this, and I think part of me does, but it feels marred by it's inability to get over itself. # if completed
