review: It's hard at first to adjust to this book, and the fact that it flatly refuses to answer any questions it poses in a concrete manner, but that's what makes it so great. It's hard to really describe what it's about apart from a dry, surface level description of the literal events, because there's so much going on that it feels like each person will come away with a different idea of what it's really about *to them*. Really looking forward to reading more Murakami in the future. # if completed (optional)
