review: For such a short read, this feels incredibly dense. One of those books where I just know reading it that it needs several rereads to fully appreciate what it's doing. But even after an initial read I appreciate all that it's doing, and it's sense of surreal hopelessness at an unknowable power. Feels weighty and philosophical without falling too far into dull sci-fi mumbo jumbo. # if completed (optional)
